<h1>rtstatistics.com Usage Agreement</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Usage Agreement is between the entity you represent, or, if you do not designate an entity in connection with a Subscription purchase or renewal, you individually (&#8220;you&#8221; or &#8220;your&#8221;), and Real-time Statistics Technologies (&#8220;rtstatistics.com&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, or &#8220;our&#8221;). It consists of the terms and conditions below, as well as the Online Services Terms, the SLAs, and the Offer Details for your Subscription or renewal (together, the &#8220;agreement&#8221;). It is effective on the date we provide you with confirmation of your Subscription or the date on which your Subscription is renewed as applicable. Key terms are defined in Section 9.</p>
<h3>1.   Use of Online Services.</h3>
<p>A.      <strong>Right to use.</strong> We grant you the right to access and use the Online Services as further described in this agreement. We reserve all other rights.</p>
<p>B.      <strong>Acceptable use. </strong>You may use the Product only in accordance with this Agreement. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or work around technical limitations in the Product, except to the extent applicable law permits it despite these limitations. You may not disable, tamper with, or otherwise attempt to circumvent any billing mechanism that meters your use of the Online Services. You may not rent, lease, lend, resell, transfer, or host the Product, or any portion thereof, to or for third parties except as expressly permitted in the Online Services Terms.</p>
<p>C.       <strong>End Users.</strong> You control access by End Users, and you are responsible for their use of the Product in accordance with this agreement. For example, you will ensure End Users comply with the Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
<p>D.      <strong>Customer Data.</strong> You are solely responsible for the content of all Customer Data. You will secure and maintain all rights in Customer Data necessary for us to provide the Online Services to you without violating the rights of any third party or otherwise obligating rtstatistics.com to you or to any third party. We do not and will not assume any obligations with respect to Customer Data or to your use of the Product other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement or as required by applicable law.</p>
<p>E.       <strong>Responsibility for your accounts.</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any non-public authentication credentials associated with your use of the Online Services. You must promptly notify our customer support team about any possible misuse of your accounts or authentication credentials or any security incident related to the Online Services.</p>
<p>F.       <strong>Preview releases. </strong>We may make Previews available.<strong> Previews are provided &#8220;as-is,&#8221; &#8220;with all faults,&#8221; and &#8220;as-available,&#8221; and are excluded from the SLAs and all limited warranties provided in this agreement. </strong>Previews may not be covered by customer support. Previews may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance, and privacy commitments, as further explained in the Online Services Terms and any additional notices provided with the Preview. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into &#8220;General Availability.&#8221;</p>
<h3>2.   Purchasing services.</h3>
<p>A.      <strong>Available Subscription offers</strong>. The Portal provides Offer Details for available Subscription offers, which generally can be categorized as one or a combination of the following:</p>
<p>B.      <strong>Ordering</strong>.</p>
<p>i.            By ordering or renewing a Subscription, you agree to the Offer Details for that Subscription. Unless otherwise specified in those Offer Details Online Services are offered on an &#8220;as available&#8221; basis. You may place orders for your Affiliates under this agreement and grant your Affiliates administrative rights to manage the Subscription, but, Affiliates may not place orders under this agreement. You also may assign the rights granted under Section 1.A to a third party for use by that third party in your internal business. If you grant any rights to Affiliates or third parties with respect to Software or your Subscription, such Affiliates or third parties will be bound by this agreement and you agree to be jointly and severally liable for any actions of such Affiliates or third parties related to their use of the Products.</p>
<p>ii.            Some offers may permit you to modify the quantity of Online Services ordered during the Term of a Subscription. Additional quantities of Online Services added to a Subscription will expire at the end of that Subscription. If you decrease the quantity during a Term, we may charge you a cancellation fee for the decrease in quantity as described below in Section 3.B.</p>
<p>C.       <strong>Pricing and payment. </strong>Payments are due and must be made according to the Offer Details for your Subscription.</p>
<p>D.      <strong>Renewal</strong>. Upon renewal of your Subscription, this agreement will terminate, and your Subscription will thereafter be governed, by the terms and conditions set forth in the Portal on the date on which your Subscription is renewed (the &#8220;Renewal Terms&#8221;). If you do not agree to any Renewal Terms, you may decline to renew your Subscription.</p>
<p>E.       <strong>Taxes</strong>. Prices are exclusive of any taxes. You must pay any applicable value added, goods and services, sales, or like taxes that are owed with respect to any order placed under this agreement and which we are permitted to collect from you under applicable law. You will be responsible for any applicable stamp taxes and for all other taxes that you are legally obligated to pay including any taxes that arise on the distribution or provision of Products to your Affiliates. We will be responsible for all taxes based on our net income or on our property ownership. If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments you make to us, you may deduct such taxes from the amount owed to us and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority; provided, however, that you promptly secure and deliver an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents we reasonably request to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. You must make certain that any taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.</p>
<h3>3.   Term, termination, and suspension.</h3>
<p>A.      <strong>Agreement term and termination.</strong> This agreement will remain in effect until the expiration, termination, or renewal of your Subscription, whichever is earliest.</p>
<p>B.      <strong>Subscription termination.</strong> You may terminate a Subscription at any time during its Term; however, you must pay all amounts due and owing before the termination is effective.</p>
<p>i.            <strong>One-Month Subscription. </strong>A Subscription having a one-month Term may be terminated anytime without any cancellation fee.</p>
<p>ii.            <strong>Subscriptions of more than one-month</strong>. If you terminate a Subscription to Online Services within 30 days of the date on which the Subscription became effective or was renewed, no refunds will be provided and you must pay for the initial 30 days of the Subscription, but no payments will be due for the remaining portion of the terminated Subscription. If you terminate a Subscription to Online Services at any other time during the term, you must pay for the remainder of the Term, and no refunds will be provided.</p>
<p>iii.            <strong>For all other Online Services</strong>, if you terminate a Subscription before the end of the Term, you must pay a fee equal to one-month&#8217;s Subscription fee and you will receive a refund of any portion of the Subscription fee you have paid for the remainder of the Term; provided, however, no refunds will be provided for partially unused months.</p>
<p>C.       <strong>Suspension. </strong>We may suspend your use of the Online Services if: (1) it is reasonably needed to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data; (2) you fail to respond to a claim of alleged infringement under Section 5 within a reasonable time; (3) you do not pay amounts due under this agreement; or (4) you do not abide by the Acceptable Use Policy or you violate other terms of this Agreement. If one or more of these conditions occurs, then a suspension will apply to the minimum necessary part of the Online Services and will be in effect only while the condition or need exists. We will give notice before we suspend, except where we reasonably believe we need to suspend immediately. We will give at least 30 days&#8217; notice before suspending for non-payment. If you do not fully address the reasons for the suspension within 60 days after we suspend, we may terminate your Subscription and delete your Customer Data without any retention period. We may also terminate your Subscription if your use of the Online Services is suspended more than twice in any 12-month period.</p>
<h3>4.   Warranties.</h3>

The party seeking protection must (i) give the other sole control over the defense and settlement of the claim; and (ii) give reasonable help in defending the claim.
